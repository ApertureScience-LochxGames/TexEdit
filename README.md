## Q & A
> Q: Why Should I use TexEdit?
 A: Because It's completely free, has no adds, is completely safe, and made by someone you can trust.
 Q: Does everything function correctly?
 A: Yes, Absolutely. I wouldn't send it out to you unless it's fully operational.
 Q: Will this get ANY updates after release?
 A: Yes, Of course! This only requires the two files in the download, so use it to your hearts desire until the next update,
 where you can use it __MORE!__
 Q: Is this Ligit?
 A: Yes, and Even though it's on github, and this place may be new to you, I release stuff all the time! Check here every week or so for updates, New
 Content, and more!
 Q: Is this a virus?
 A: No, of course not! I wouldn't make a virus if I got the whole world 5 seconds later! Viruses are terible. I make FAKE viruses, not ones that harm computers. I make ones for jumps, and for laughs! Not to steal info!
Q: Is this runnable without Python?
A: No, it's unable to run unless you have python installed, bacause the exe was to big to put in. The steps to download are simple:
> Download Python, then run ```pip install pyinstaller``` in CMD or Bash and hit enter. It will install PYINSTALLER into your directory, then type: ```pyinstaller --onefile --icon=TexEdit.png TexEdit.py``` (Or you can paste that) into Bash or CMD while in the directory of the TexEdit.py File. Open the "dist " folder and put the TexEdit.png file inside, then run TexEdit. It will open as if you opened it with python. I wanted to upload an exe, but sadly it's too big.
